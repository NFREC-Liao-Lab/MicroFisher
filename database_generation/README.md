# Description
## The code list in this folder is used for the generation of hypervariable marker databases, including marker sequences collection, preprocessing, and truncation.

### Since creating these hypervariable marker databases is computationally intensive, we provided the latest reference databases and updated information for users to download and use directly in the MicroFisher pipeline.
### Users are not supposed to create a custom MicroFisher database unless necessary.
