#Description
The codes list in this folder are used for generation of hypervariable marker databases, including marker sequences collection, preprocessing, and truncation.

Since the process of creating these hypervariable marker databases is computationally intensive, we provided the latest reference databases and updated information for the users to download for direct use in the MicroFisher pipeline.
Users are not supposed to created a custom database for MicroFisher unless necessary.
